# Details
An iOS app in Swift that lists Star Wars characters using the open API (https://swapi.dev/) and targeted at iOS 13.0+
SWAPIApp lists the names of all Star Wars characters in alphabetical order (using the /api/people endpoint). Selecting a name on the list opens a detail view that displays their name, birth year, and physical attributes (height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color and gender). The detail view also includes the name of all the films the character appears in and also the word count of the opening_crawl attribute for each film.
